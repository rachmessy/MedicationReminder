//The way this works currently:
//on start up it should display "no weight detected" on the lcd display
//then if you place a weight on the tray: the lcd should write whatever the weight sensor detected as "weight: xx.xx grams"
//if you remove the weight before 10 seconds the LED should not turn on at all.
//if you hold the weight on for more than 10 seconds, the LED should then turn on: this is to mimic the reminder function
//if you remove the weight after 10 seconds the LED should turn back off.
