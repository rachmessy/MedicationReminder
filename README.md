How to use:
(assuming you have "purchased" the one and only medication reminder)
  1. Plug the Aruino Uno into your computer with USB
  2. go to MedicationReminder/final/medication_reminder_final.ino
  3. copy this file and put it in an Arduino sketch on the Arduino IDE
  4. Make sure that no weight is currently on the sensors
  5. verify and upload this code
  6. add a medication to one of the slots 
  7. watch as the stopwatch will now display in the corresponding slot on the display
  8. (if you take the medication off before 10 seconds then no LED will turn on and the stopwatch will reset)
  9. BUT, when the stopwatch does reach 10 seconds the corresponding LED will turn on
  10. if the medication is removed after this time the display and LED will reset
  11. now try using all 3 slots tpgether!
